I have them do various things like keylog, take screenshots, and infect files. \n I sometimes code the viruses by myself using C, or I use tools like metasploit to help me create payloads and backdoors. I learned to make malware through tutorials on the internet. I also test these viruses against antivirus in order to test what the best antivirus software may be against viruses that evade antivirus.",
