    <h1 style="text-align: center">Types of Hacks</h1>
    <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
      <p>
        SQL injections are performed by adding a ‘ or “ in a username/password field. They work because if the code written insecurely, the ‘ or the “ breaks the username/password string and allows you access to the whole SQL database. Because it is such an easy and common attack, almost all sites have this vulnerability patched.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Cross-Site Scripting</h2>
        <p>
          Cross-Site Scripting (or XSS) attacks are performed by writing javascript inside a user form field. They work because of insecurely formatted code which allows the user to input javascript. It is a common and easy attack, so almost all sites have this vulnerability patched
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Command Execution</h2>
        <p>
          Command Execution is performed by writing commands in a user input field. They work if user input fields are not sanitized and users can directly input commands into the shell. It is quite a common attack, so most websites have this vulnerability patched
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Clickjacking</h2>
        <p>
          Clickjacking attacks are performed by creating a new URL that looks like a popular site, then adding a harmful link. They work if a site has not disabled z-frames, and through social engineering. It is an often overlooked attack, so a medium amount of sites have this vulnerability patched
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>
        <p>
          A Cross-Site Request Forgery (or CSRF) attack is performed by adding a malicious payload directly to a URL, and having a user click on the bad link. They work if a site has not protected cookies and user sessions, and through social engineering. It is a common attack, so most sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Directory Traversal</h2>
        <p>
          Directory Traversal attacks are performed by adding a file path to a URL and accessing sensitive server-side files. They work if file names are not sanitized and if sensitive files are stored alongside public ones. This is a common attack, so almost all sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Reflected XSS</h2>
        <p>
          Reflected XSS attacks are performed by adding malicious javascript directly to the link of a site, usually in a search parameter. They work if the terms are not sanitized, and are often paired with social engineering. Much like XSS, it is a common and easy attack, so almost all sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Dom-Based XSS</h2>
        <p>
          Dom-Based XSS attacks are performed by adding malicious code in a URI fragment (the part of the URL after the # that usually signifies a user’s location). They work if the URI fragment is not sanitized, and is often paired with social engineering. This is a rarer attack, so less sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>File Upload Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>
          File Upload Vulnerability attacks are performed by uploading a hack to a server using a site’s file upload system. They work if file names (and extensions) are not renamed, and file checking is done in javascript or not at all. This is a somewhat common attack, so a medium amount of sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Broken Access Control</h2>
        <p>
          Broken Access Control hacks are performed by accessing a private part of a website (ex: unreleased content) by guessing/wordlist-ing pages. They work if names of pages are easy to guess and if the site relies of obfuscating data rather than authentication. They are an uncommon attack, but many sites do not rely on obscuring.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Open Redirects</h2>
        <p>
          Open Redirect hacks are performed by sending spam using a benevolent site’s URL and bypassing emails’ anti-phishing measures. They work if sites do not check their redirect links so redirects can lead to any other site, and through social engineering. They are a common attack, so most sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Unencrypted Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Unencrypted Communication hacks are performed by being a “man in the middle” on shared WiFi (they are also known as MITM attacks). They work if sites use HTTP instead of HTTPS, which uses the safer Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Most sites use HTTPS and retain their certificates, so most sites have this vulnerability patched.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>User Enumeration</h2>
        <p>
          User Enumeration hacks are performed by brute forcing accounts based on error messages. They work if a site uses specific instead of generic error messages for failed logins. Most sites do not have this vulnerability patched for user convenience; however, it is an uncommon attack due to the brute-force nature.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Information Leakage</h2>
        <p>
          Information Leakage hacks are performed by getting information about a server to find specific exploits. They work if a site reveals too much info about their server or file structure to the user. It is a relatively common attack, so most sites are careful to not leak too much information.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Password Mismanagement</h2>
        <p>
          Password Mismanagement hacks are performed by brute forcing easy-to-guess or unsafely stored passwords. They work if a site does not have restrictions on passwords and if they are not hashed. Most sites store passwords securely and have some creation criteria, so this hack is difficult.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>
        <p>
          Privilege Escalation hacks are performed by editing variables in a site (by inspecting element or viewing cookies). They work if a site has insecure cookies or if there is sensitive information written in the HTML. This is a common attack, so almost all sites are patched to this vulnerability.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Session Fixation</h2>
        <p>
          Session Fixation hacks are performed by crafting a malicious URL and directing a user to sign in with it. They work if a site has session IDs in their URL and because of social engineering. This is an easy attack, so most sites are patched to this vulnerability.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Weak Session IDs</h2>
        <p>
          Weak Session ID hacks are performed by brute forcing session IDs and seeing which one(s) work. They work if session IDs are short and/or not encrypted. This is a common attack and most safe session IDs are a must nowadays, so most sites are patched to this vulnerability.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>XML Bombs</h2>
        <p>
          XML bombs hacks are performed by editing an XML file’s inline DTD to keep expanding and crash the server (crashes at around 3GB). They work if a site accepts XML uploads or if a parser still uses inline DTDs. This is an uncommon attack, so quite a few sites are vulnerable to this hack.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>XML External Entities</h2>
        <p>
          XML External Entities hacks are performed by crafting a malicious URL to get sensitive server data files. They work if inline DTDs are enabled and if redirects are not sanitized. This is an uncommon attack, so quite a few sites are vulnerable to this hack.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Denial of Service Attacks</h2>
        <p>
          Denial of Service attacks are performed by sending a massive amount of packets to a server, rendering people unable to connect. They work if there is no DoS/DDoS protection on a site. This is a very common attack, however it is extremely difficult to prevent against this hack.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Email Spoofing</h2>
        <p>
          Email spoofing attacks are performed by creating a fake email that looks like a reputable password change. They work if an email provider does not have phishing protection, and through social engineering. This is a common attack, however most email providers protect against these attacks.
        </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Malvertizing</h2>
        <p>
          Malvertizing attacks are performed by advertising malware on reputable sites. They work on any site that has third party advertising and through social engineering. This is a common attack, however it is still very prevalent because it requires thorough vetting on third-party advertisements.
        </p>
