    <h2>Overview: What Is A Hacker?</h2>
      <p>
        A hacker is someone who programmatically gains access to nonpublic parts of a computer, site, or server by taking advantage of holes in security, bugs in software, or self-made applications. (Note: there is no mention of elicit purposes, a specific motive, or a hoodie.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different types or "hats" of hackers. These definitions change in different tech circles, but these are the main ones.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>The Black Hat Hacker: the classic cyber-criminal</h2>
      <p>
        The black hat hacker is your famous online thief who steals passwords, user data, etc.; There is often a monetary motive attached to their hacks. These are the hackers that drain your bank account, blackmail you, hold your files for ransom, and/or try to scam you. They are also the ones who create malware that infects your computer. These hackers are punished with prison time if they are caught. When people say the word “hacker”, this type of hacker usually comes to mind.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>The Gray Hat Hacker: the risky hacker</h2>
      <p>
        These hackers hack systems without permission from a company, but don’t do anything malicious with their power; they sometimes tell the company about the bug later and help fix it. Their hacks are risky, because their actions are illegal but charges are often not pressed. Sometimes these hackers are even later hired as security consultants by the company they are hacking. They are in the “grey area” of hacking, as there is no consensus on how to deal with this group
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>The White Hat Hacker: the “good” hacker</h2>
      <p>
        Also called ethical hackers or security consultants, these hackers are benevolent. They are paid by companies and they are given explicit consent to hack a product. They hack the system in order to find security bugs for companies to fix. Because of white hat hackers, products are safer and less exploitable for black hat hackers. These hackers often work with anti-hacking tool companies such as providers of antivirus and firewall software. These hackers are often freelancers but can be in groups as well.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>The Red Hat Hacker: the vigilante hacker:</h2>
      <p>
        This is the “hacktivist” or “whistle blower” hacker. They often exist in organizations, such as Anonymous or LulzSec, and they perform mass hacks, often for some political reason. They can also be anarchists who want to bring down governments or enjoy causing chaos. They often try to pedal conspiracies online, sometimes hacking sites or creating bots to make their ideas more popular. Hackers for government organizations sometimes fall into this category. They don’t really have a monetary motive, their hacks are political.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>The Blue Hat Hacker: the revenge hacker:</h2>
      <p>
        This is often the “disgruntled ex” or the “angry employee.” They are usually not proficient in hacking, but instead use hacking tools to seek revenge on one specific person or company. They can extort money, blackmail people, or cause mayhem because they feel wronged. People who hack scammers or black hat hackers sometimes also fall into this category Their actions are illegal, however some people sympathize with their motives. Their hacks are almost always targeted, however they can cause extensive damage.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>The Green Hat Hacker: the newbie hacker:</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes known as “script kiddies” or “pracksters,” they rely on pre-made scripts and copy tutorials with little knowledge of how it works. They often perform attacks to impress friends or as a joke, but some are just hackers who are still learning. They can be quite dangerous, as they don’t always understand the consequences or severity of their hacks. Even if they do not cause damage purposefully, they can face unforeseen charges. Some green hats grow into black or white hat hackers as they learn.
