    <br />
    <h2>Overview: The Different Types of Malware That Might Infect Your Computer</h2>
      <p>
        Most malware is a combination of 2 or more of these categories. These catagories are just the main ones.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Virus: the most famous malware</h2>
      <p>
        A virus is a piece of malware that can replicate itself and infect/delete other files. It can spread across a system and to other computers through infected files, however it requires user input to run on a system. The main goal of a virus is to infect the system and cause damage to important files
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Worm: the master reproducer</h2>
      <p>
        A worm is a piece of malware that is able to reproduce across an infected network. It is a standalone program, so it does not need user input or a host file to be activated. The goal of a worm is to spread very quickly and take up processing power, although they can contain payloads as well
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Trojan: the sexiest malware</h2>
      <p>
        A trojan horse uses social engineering to spread, promising legitimate software to a user. However, when the fake software is executed, a payload is released and can damage your computer. They generally do not infect other systems or overwrite user files, but steal information such as passwords/bank information.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Ransomware: the hostage taker</h2>
      <p>
        Ransomware is software that encrypts computer files and demands bitcoin to release them. It can be spread in various ways, but it usually relies on a already placed backdoor. Sometimes an element of blackmail is also added to the software, as they threaten to release files or webcam footage
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Adware: the unstoppable popup</h2>
      <p>
        Adware typically attaches to a browser, often in the form of an extension/add-on. It can change advertisements on websites (“malvertizing”), create excess/unclosable pop-ups, and redirect you to other (usually not PG-rated) sites. Adware is usually downloaded by the user and is not spreadable, but they often advertise other forms of malware.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Spyware: always watching you</h2>
      <p>
        Spyware is malware that can record you, take screenshots, and log your keystrokes without your consent. Their purpose is to steal credential information and/or blackmail you. They are downloaded by a user and do not spread, but can be used with other malware.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Rootkit: the hidden boss</h2>
      <p>
        A rootkit has the ability to give a piece of software or a remote hacker administrative access to a computer. Rootkits do not always contain payloads, but they are considered malware because they elevate privileges, often without consent. They do not spread alone, and are usually downloaded by a user
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>DoS: the attention seeker</h2>
      <p>
        Denial of Service malware is a system that usurps so much CPU/memory that it makes a computer unusable. For example fork bombs, zip bombs, XDoS or Banana attacks can prevent the user from opening any application or connecting to the internet. DoS malware takes advantage of holes in popular software, so it affects many users at once. (Note: DoS malware is not to be confused with web based DoS/DDoS attacks which affect websites)
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Crypto-malware: the secret moneymaker</h2>
      <p>
        Crypto-malware does not harm computers, but instead allocates a percent of its CPU for bitcoin mining. It is localized to one computer, but many computers can form a botnet of miners. They make money for the hacker, and most users do not even know they have malware as they just experience worse performance.
      </p>
      <br />
    <h2>Botnet Malware: the hidden weapon</h2>
      <p>
        Botnet malware sneaks on to your computer and lays dormant. It can spread to other computers through a network or through infected files. When a signal is given, the infected computers can be damaged at once or the botnet can be used to DDoS major servers, causing chaos.
